    </p>

    <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels)

    </p>

    <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social
        media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to
        do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media
        provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media
        provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and
        profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a
        social media platform.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in
        this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services.
        Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your
        personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that
        you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your

    </p>

    <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
        purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or
        permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose
        in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the
        period of time in which users have an account with us.
    </p>

    <h2>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

    <p>
        In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
        organizational and technical security measures.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
        security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
        electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
        guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
        cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
        we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
        Services within a secure environment.

        In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years
        of age.
    </p>

    <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age.
        By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the
        parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of
        the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of
        age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
        measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of
        any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us
        at helpdesk.maisonmate@gmail.com.

        your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data
        protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details
        here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank">Data Protection Authorities</a>.

        authorities are available here: <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html" target="_blank">Swiss Data Protection Authorities</a>.
    </p>

    <p>

        provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"

        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before
        its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted
        in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Account Information
    </p>

    <p>
        If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or
        terminate your account, you can:

        information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
        investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal
        requirements.

    </p>

    <h2>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

    <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
        include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your
        privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
        and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
        implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond
        to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
        your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
        we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
        version of this privacy notice.
    </p>

    <h2>12. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

    <p>
        In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights
        regarding access to your personal information.
    </p>

    <p>
        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law,
        permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a
        year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any)
        we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and
        addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the
        immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like
        to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact
        information provided below.

        indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as
        soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may
